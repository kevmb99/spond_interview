Thank you for reviewing my Git repo! The metrics I have chosen to explore are:
 * Activation: First membership, first event, and first payment displayed by country and the rates at which they are activated
 * Weekly Retention: Percentage of users from this week who returned next week
 * Engagement Depth: Number of weeks in the past 4 that teams held events and percentage of teams that engaged at each rate (by Country and Activity as well). Percentage of teams that were constantly engaged since creation on Spond
 * Monetization: Teams that are using spond to pay vs teams that held an activity each week. Percentage of teams with events in past 4 weeks that processed payments (by Country and Activity as well). Revenue by week for paying clubs.
